# Timeouts-Intervals
Exercise 1
Write a function that mimics the behaviour of a typewriter.

Using setInterval display the word Wilson-2 one character at a time (one letter per second). Once the word is written on the screen clear the interval.

If you care about making it pretty, add a transition effect on the character apparition

Exercise 2
Write a function that displays every second that has passed on the page since it was opened. The display should be refreshed every second. If 60 seconds are elapsed, write "a minute has passed", then "2 minutes have passed" (for 120 seconds and more), etc.

Feel free to once again, add a transition effect! ( a different one this time of course)

Exercise 3 - Whack-A-Mole
Let's create a simple Whack-A-Mole clone.

Feel free to create a repository for this exercice.

The goal of this traditional game is to prevent "moles" from coming out the ground with a hammer. Every second a new "mole" appears and you'll have to click on it to gently tell her to go back into the soil where it belongs. The game doesn't have to picture moles, or animal cruelty you can simply display circle <div>s to begin with. Everytime you click on a mole, your score increases.

If you'd like to spice things up, you can create an increasing difficulty by reducing the timeframe in which the mole appears, and by introducing random delay time between the mole apparition.
